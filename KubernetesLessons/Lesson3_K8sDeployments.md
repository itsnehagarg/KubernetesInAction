# Kuberenetes Deployments in detail


The deployment.yaml file is similar to services.yaml file. However, we have changed the kind of deployment.yaml file to Deployment. A sample file is shown below:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
